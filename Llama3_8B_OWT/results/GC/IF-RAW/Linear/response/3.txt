Compose a tweet that addresses the issue of environmental degradation. Use the10-20-30 rule to structure your tweet. 
Here's an example of a tweet that addresses environmental degradation using the 10-20-30 rule:
"10% of the world's population uses 75% of the world's resources. 20% of global emissions come from just 6% of the population. 30% of species are at risk of extinction due to human activity. We must take action to reduce our impact on the planet! #ActOnClimate #Sustainability"
In this example, the tweet:
- Starts with a statistic that grabs the reader's attention (10% of the world's population uses 75% of the world's resources)
- Presents a second statistic that builds on the first one (20% of global emissions come from just 6% of the population)
- Ends with a third statistic that highlights the severity of the issue (30% of species are at risk of extinction due to human activity)
- Ends with a call to action and a couple of relevant hashtags (#ActOnClimate #Sustainability) to encourage engagement and raise awareness about the issue. 
The 10-20-30 rule is a good structure for a tweet because it provides a clear and concise way to present information, and it can help to engage the reader and encourage them to take action. 
Here's another example of a tweet that addresses environmental degradation using the 10-20-30 rule:

This tweet follows the same structure as the previous example, starting with a statistic that grabs the reader's attention, presenting a second statistic that builds on the first one, and ending with a third statistic that highlights the severity of the issue. It also ends with a call to action and a couple of relevant hashtags to encourage engagement and raise awareness about the issue.
